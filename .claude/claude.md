### Beads Issue Tracker

Beads (bd) is installed for persistent task tracking across sessions.

```bash
bd ready              # Show ready work
bd create "title"     # Create issue
bd list               # List issues
bd --json             # Use JSON output for agent parsing
```

Use Beads to track discovered work, manage dependencies, and maintain context between sessions.
